This project is used to interpolate ECHAM-HAM model grid to the station locations where marine aerosol observations were
available

--Run main.py to perform the interpolation adding "SVD" or "NAO" as argument words to perform the interpolation of
lipids and proteins or polysaccharides, respectively. Also <sbatch run_python_main.sh> can be used to run it in levante
with "SVD" default option.
This script will create pickle files with the observations and interpolated model data (*_conc.pkl) for each biomolecule
that can later be used for the plots.

--global_vars.py contains all global variables
- Directories to model and observational data
- model experiment
- model tracers considered in the comparison

-- mixed_box_plots.py will create all relevant figures (as box plots):
- Box plot of observed and interpolated values of all organic marine aerosol tracers concentration and OMF (PMOA_plots.py)
- Box plot of observed and interpolated values of sea salt concentration (SS_plots.py file)
- Box plot of observed (OM) and interpolated values of OC (SPMOAoff experiment) concentration and OC+PMOA (SPMOAon
experiment) (OC_plots.py file)
- Statistics of this comparison is file statistics.log

Analysis of Arctic stations and Mace Head
--Run main_Arctic.py to perform the interpolation of PMOA at inner Arctic stations and Mace Head. Additionally,
<sbatch run_python_main_arctic.sh> can be used to run it in levante

-- plot_arctic_seasonaltiy.py creates figures of monthly observed and interpolated values at Mace Head (August 2015 and
2018) and other stations within the Arctic
